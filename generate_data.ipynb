The village is the site of the ancient Goguryeo city of Baegam (Hangul :백암성, Hanja :白巖城) in Korea or Baiyan City (Chinese: 白岩城) in Chinese. The ancient city was the scene a major battle between the Tang dynasty Chinese emperor Taizong and the Goguryeo in 645 AD.\\n\\nHistory\\nThe city dates to 403 AD and was built by the Goguryeo people who occupied much of the Liaodong Peninsula, modern Jilin province, Northern Korean Peninsula and part of the Primorsky Krai in modern Russia. Yanzhou was a major city at the frontier between the Goguryeo and Tang dynasty China.\\nIn 642 AD, the Goguryeo had a war with the neighbouring land of Silla on the Korean Peninsula. The Silla appealed to the Tang Emperor for assistance and in 645, the Emperor Taizong attacked the Goguryeo. The Tang first captured nearby Liaodong City. Then in June, they attacked at Yanzhou led by Tang Jun and after fierce fighting and some notable heroics by the Emperor and his generals, won.\\n\\nLocation\\nThe city was built on a ridge on the northern side of the Taizi River.  (Chinese: 太子河; pinyin: Tàizǐhé), approximately 20 km east of Liaoyang and 50 km south of Shenyang (Chinese: 沈阳; pinyin: Shěnyáng).\\n\\nConstruction\\nAs with other Goguryeo forts, Yanzhou village was built on a hill adjacent to a river, with the river forming a natural barrier.  Cliffs form the southern side of the city and a high defensive wall formed an arch around the west, north and east sides.  The land slopes such that the eastern side of the city is significantly higher than the west. The site is about 480 metres long and 440 metres wide. The city walls, which are still visible today, cover some 1840 metres in length. The walls were 2 to 3 metres thick and between 5 and 8 metres high with towers at regular intervals along its length, and is comparable to the Great Wall of China in its dimensions. At the top of the ridge are the remains of a square tower with a wall enclosed area to its east. The gate to the city was to the west, near the Taizi River. The construction is of rough-cut stone built dry without mortar.\\n\\nStatus\\nThe city walls in Yanzhou are a protected site of Liaoning province.  Despite its protected status, some of the western sections of the city walls have been dismantled by the adjacent villagers and stones taken from the wall can be seen in various homes and fences throughout the village.  By comparison, the city walls on the northern and eastern sections appear to be in good condition.\\n\\nAccessibility\\nAs of 2014 the site was not developed to encourage tourism and there was no tourist infrastructure present to facilitate tourism related activities within the city walls. Access to the site was neither monitored nor actively controlled.\\nThe city can be easily reached by automobile, as paved roads connect it to both Liaoyang and Shenyang.\\nPassage 5:\\nYanzhou District\\nYanzhou (postal: Yenchow; simplified Chinese: 兖州; traditional Chinese: 兗州; pinyin: Yǎnzhōu) is a district in the prefecture-level city of Jining, in the southwest of Shandong province, People\\'s Republic of China. It was also the name of one of the Nine Provinces in ancient China, where Yu combated floods by water control.\\n\\nAdministration\\nYanzhou District administers six subdistricts and six towns:\\n\\nSubdistricts (街道)\\nTowns (镇)\\nHistory\\nYanzhou was the first place to install the \"school-fields\" xuetian in 1022, during the Song dynasty.In early European sources, based on accounts by French missionaries, the name of Yanzhou (Fu) is transcribed in the contemporary French manner, as Yen-tcheou-fou; however, when reading 18th- and 19th-century books in French or English, care should be taken not to confuse Yanzhou in Shandong with the identically transcribed Yanzhou in Zhejiang.\\n\\nGeology\\nThe land structure of the Yinzhou area belongs to the Luxi fault block uplift (level III) and the Zhangzhou fault (Grade IV) unit. The eastern part of the boundary is the Yishan fault, the west is the Sunshidian fault, and the north is the Wensi fault. It is the Fushan fault. Yanzhou is part of it. The basement is the metamorphic rock series of the Mount Tai Group. The Paleozoic, Mesozoic and Cenozoic strata are developed above the basement. Among them, rich industrial coal seams are formed in the Late Paleozoic strata, which is an important base for Yanzhou becoming national coal resources. The tectonic movement in the territory has shaped various structural topography, which are roughly two types of fault structure and fold structure. The strata of all walks of life are developed from the old to the new for the Early Paleozoic strata, the Paleozoic strata, the Mesozoic strata, and the Neogene stratigraphic strata. In the early Paleozoic, the horizon was in a state of slow decline, with large-scale transgression, and the deposition of thick shallow sand shale and carbonate rock formations. The Ordovician rocks in the Paleozoic are mainly light gray and gray thick layered limestone, crystalline limestone and leopard skin limestone; the Carboniferous rocks are mainly gray-white siltstone, clay rock, shale and thin layer limestone. Several layers of coal; the two rocks are mainly grayish white, dark gray sandstone and variegated mudstone and brown shale, rich in plant fossils. The Mesozoic Jurassic rocks are mainly brown sandstone, conglomerate, variegated mudstone and glutenite. The Cenozoic is made up of Tertiary and Quaternary strata. The Tertiary is sandstone, sticky sandstone, and mudstone; the Quaternary strata are loose rock formations composed of Wenyu alluvial deposits. The west is the Wenhe alluvial fan, the east is the Weihe alluvial fan, and the two overlapping alluvial fans are located in the area of Qianqian-Da\\'an-Tianqi Temple.\\nYanzhou District is located in the sloping plain of the southwestern part of the Mount Tai in the Luzhong Mountains. The west is flooded by the flood waters, and the flood alluvial landforms are obvious; the eastern waters are discharged to the southwest, and the terrain is inclined from the northeast to the southwest; the central Guangfu River and the Yangjiahe River are parallel and the terrain is low. The ground elevation is 60~38 meters, the height difference is 22 meters and the average elevation is 49 meters, and the average slope is 1/1500. The northeast is affected by the structure and is a shallow buried area of the Tertiary, with a large slope on the ground. The plain area is 64,670 hectares, accounting for 99.7% of the total area; it is divided into three types: micro-sloping ground, depression and slow-moving. The area is 45,601 hectares, accounting for 70.35% of the total area; the area is 12276.9 hectares, accounting for 18.94% of the total area; the area is 6792.2 hectares, accounting for 10.48% of the total area.\\nThe hills in the territory belong to the bedrock of the Mount Tai hidden under the Quaternary cover. There is a hill 15 kilometers west of the city, named Ziyang Mountain. It is the only hill in Yanzhou. It is a bare hill of the Ordovician limestone. It is a low hill type. It is divided into two peaks, east peak is 75 meters above sea level, and west peak is 72.5 meters above sea level. The mountain is spread from east to west, 1.5 kilometers long and one kilometer wide, covering an area of 1.5 square kilometers. The rock is limestone, and the Qing Dynasty has been sporadic mining, although it is forbidden. In the later period of the \"Cultural Revolution\", the trees on the mountain were cut down, and the mountain quarry was cut off. The East Peak had become a deep valley, and the west peak still existed.\\n\\nClimate\\nYanzhou has a monsoon-influenced, four-season humid continental climate (Köppen Dwa). Winters are cold and dry while summers are hot and humid. Monthly daily average temperatures range from −1.0 °C (30.2 °F) in January to 26.8 °C (80.2 °F), while the annual mean temperature is 13.79 °C (56.8 °F). More than 70% of the annual precipitation occurs from June to September, with barely any occurring in the winter months. The city receives 2,461 hours of bright sunshine annually.\\n\\nEconomy\\n2012 GDP reached 50.62 billion yuan, up 13.1 percent; local fiscal revenue 3.008 billion yuan, an increase of 22.65%; major economic indicators higher than the provincial average, income growth higher than the GDP growth rate of urban and rural residents. First three quarters of 2012, the GDP of 41.35 billion yuan, an increase of 11.9%; 1–10 months, local fiscal revenue 3.13 billion yuan, up 14.4 percent; 17.94 billion yuan in fixed assets investment, an increase of 22.9%.Yanzhou Coal Mining Company is headquartered in Yanzhou.\\nThe economic aggregate has reached a new level. According to preliminary calculations, in 2017, the region\\'s Gross Regional Product (GDP) exceeded 70 billion yuan, reaching 72.312 billion yuan, a year-on-year increase of 6.7% at comparable prices. Among them, the added value of the primary industry was 4.659 billion yuan, up 2.8% year-on-year; the added value of the secondary industry was 39.699 billion yuan, up 6.1% year-on-year; the added value of the tertiary industry was 27.954 billion yuan, up 8.4% year-on-year. According to the industry, the added value of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry and fishery was 4.794 billion yuan, up 3.2%; the industrial added value was 35.909 billion yuan, up 6.8%; the construction industry added value was 3.808 billion yuan, down 0.4%; the wholesale and retail industry added value was 7.805 billion yuan. , an increase of 1.9%; transportation, warehousing and postal industry added value of 2.267 billion yuan, an increase of 8.6%; accommodation and catering industry added value of 891 million yuan, an increase of 2.6%; financial industry added value of 2.094 billion yuan, an increase of 12%; real estate industry The added value was 1.197 billion yuan, an increase of 4.9%; the added value of other service industries was 13.547 billion yuan, an increase of 12.6%.

The village is the site of the ancient Goguryeo city of Baegam (Hangul :백암성, Hanja :白巖城) in Korea or Baiyan City (Chinese: 白岩城) in Chinese. The ancient city was the scene a major battle between the Tang dynasty Chinese emperor Taizong and the Goguryeo in 645 AD.\\n\\nHistory\\nThe city dates to 403 AD and was built by the Goguryeo people who occupied much of the Liaodong Peninsula, modern Jilin province, Northern Korean Peninsula and part of the Primorsky Krai in modern Russia. Yanzhou was a major city at the frontier between the Goguryeo and Tang dynasty China.\\nIn 642 AD, the Goguryeo had a war with the neighbouring land of Silla on the Korean Peninsula. The Silla appealed to the Tang Emperor for assistance and in 645, the Emperor Taizong attacked the Goguryeo. The Tang first captured nearby Liaodong City. Then in June, they attacked at Yanzhou led by Tang Jun and after fierce fighting and some notable heroics by the Emperor and his generals, won.\\n\\nLocation\\nThe city was built on a ridge on the northern side of the Taizi River.  (Chinese: 太子河; pinyin: Tàizǐhé), approximately 20 km east of Liaoyang and 50 km south of Shenyang (Chinese: 沈阳; pinyin: Shěnyáng).\\n\\nConstruction\\nAs with other Goguryeo forts, Yanzhou village was built on a hill adjacent to a river, with the river forming a natural barrier.  Cliffs form the southern side of the city and a high defensive wall formed an arch around the west, north and east sides.  The land slopes such that the eastern side of the city is significantly higher than the west. The site is about 480 metres long and 440 metres wide. The city walls, which are still visible today, cover some 1840 metres in length. The walls were 2 to 3 metres thick and between 5 and 8 metres high with towers at regular intervals along its length, and is comparable to the Great Wall of China in its dimensions. At the top of the ridge are the remains of a square tower with a wall enclosed area to its east. The gate to the city was to the west, near the Taizi River. The construction is of rough-cut stone built dry without mortar.\\n\\nStatus\\nThe city walls in Yanzhou are a protected site of Liaoning province.  Despite its protected status, some of the western sections of the city walls have been dismantled by the adjacent villagers and stones taken from the wall can be seen in various homes and fences throughout the village.  By comparison, the city walls on the northern and eastern sections appear to be in good condition.\\n\\nAccessibility\\nAs of 2014 the site was not developed to encourage tourism and there was no tourist infrastructure present to facilitate tourism related activities within the city walls. Access to the site was neither monitored nor actively controlled.\\nThe city can be easily reached by automobile, as paved roads connect it to both Liaoyang and Shenyang.\\nPassage 5:\\nYanzhou District\\nYanzhou (postal: Yenchow; simplified Chinese: 兖州; traditional Chinese: 兗州; pinyin: Yǎnzhōu) is a district in the prefecture-level city of Jining, in the southwest of Shandong province, People\\'s Republic of China. It was also the name of one of the Nine Provinces in ancient China, where Yu combated floods by water control.\\n\\nAdministration\\nYanzhou District administers six subdistricts and six towns:\\n\\nSubdistricts (街道)\\nTowns (镇)\\nHistory\\nYanzhou was the first place to install the \"school-fields\" xuetian in 1022, during the Song dynasty.In early European sources, based on accounts by French missionaries, the name of Yanzhou (Fu) is transcribed in the contemporary French manner, as Yen-tcheou-fou; however, when reading 18th- and 19th-century books in French or English, care should be taken not to confuse Yanzhou in Shandong with the identically transcribed Yanzhou in Zhejiang.\\n\\nGeology\\nThe land structure of the Yinzhou area belongs to the Luxi fault block uplift (level III) and the Zhangzhou fault (Grade IV) unit. The eastern part of the boundary is the Yishan fault, the west is the Sunshidian fault, and the north is the Wensi fault. It is the Fushan fault. Yanzhou is part of it. The basement is the metamorphic rock series of the Mount Tai Group. The Paleozoic, Mesozoic and Cenozoic strata are developed above the basement. Among them, rich industrial coal seams are formed in the Late Paleozoic strata, which is an important base for Yanzhou becoming national coal resources. The tectonic movement in the territory has shaped various structural topography, which are roughly two types of fault structure and fold structure. The strata of all walks of life are developed from the old to the new for the Early Paleozoic strata, the Paleozoic strata, the Mesozoic strata, and the Neogene stratigraphic strata. In the early Paleozoic, the horizon was in a state of slow decline, with large-scale transgression, and the deposition of thick shallow sand shale and carbonate rock formations. The Ordovician rocks in the Paleozoic are mainly light gray and gray thick layered limestone, crystalline limestone and leopard skin limestone; the Carboniferous rocks are mainly gray-white siltstone, clay rock, shale and thin layer limestone. Several layers of coal; the two rocks are mainly grayish white, dark gray sandstone and variegated mudstone and brown shale, rich in plant fossils. The Mesozoic Jurassic rocks are mainly brown sandstone, conglomerate, variegated mudstone and glutenite. The Cenozoic is made up of Tertiary and Quaternary strata. The Tertiary is sandstone, sticky sandstone, and mudstone; the Quaternary strata are loose rock formations composed of Wenyu alluvial deposits. The west is the Wenhe alluvial fan, the east is the Weihe alluvial fan, and the two overlapping alluvial fans are located in the area of Qianqian-Da\\'an-Tianqi Temple.\\nYanzhou District is located in the sloping plain of the southwestern part of the Mount Tai in the Luzhong Mountains. The west is flooded by the flood waters, and the flood alluvial landforms are obvious; the eastern waters are discharged to the southwest, and the terrain is inclined from the northeast to the southwest; the central Guangfu River and the Yangjiahe River are parallel and the terrain is low. The ground elevation is 60~38 meters, the height difference is 22 meters and the average elevation is 49 meters, and the average slope is 1/1500. The northeast is affected by the structure and is a shallow buried area of the Tertiary, with a large slope on the ground. The plain area is 64,670 hectares, accounting for 99.7% of the total area; it is divided into three types: micro-sloping ground, depression and slow-moving. The area is 45,601 hectares, accounting for 70.35% of the total area; the area is 12276.9 hectares, accounting for 18.94% of the total area; the area is 6792.2 hectares, accounting for 10.48% of the total area.\\nThe hills in the territory belong to the bedrock of the Mount Tai hidden under the Quaternary cover. There is a hill 15 kilometers west of the city, named Ziyang Mountain. It is the only hill in Yanzhou. It is a bare hill of the Ordovician limestone. It is a low hill type. It is divided into two peaks, east peak is 75 meters above sea level, and west peak is 72.5 meters above sea level. The mountain is spread from east to west, 1.5 kilometers long and one kilometer wide, covering an area of 1.5 square kilometers. The rock is limestone, and the Qing Dynasty has been sporadic mining, although it is forbidden. In the later period of the \"Cultural Revolution\", the trees on the mountain were cut down, and the mountain quarry was cut off. The East Peak had become a deep valley, and the west peak still existed.\\n\\nClimate\\nYanzhou has a monsoon-influenced, four-season humid continental climate (Köppen Dwa). Winters are cold and dry while summers are hot and humid. Monthly daily average temperatures range from −1.0 °C (30.2 °F) in January to 26.8 °C (80.2 °F), while the annual mean temperature is 13.79 °C (56.8 °F). More than 70% of the annual precipitation occurs from June to September, with barely any occurring in the winter months.

If you don\\'t know the answer just say that you don\\'t know. Use three sentences maximum and keep the answer concise.\\n<</SYS>>\\n\\n```\\nPassage 1:\\nHuernia\\nThe genus Huernia (family Apocynaceae, subfamily Asclepiadoideae) consists of perennial, stem succulents from Eastern and Southern Africa and Arabia, first described as a genus in 1810.The flowers are five-lobed, usually somewhat more funnel- or bell-shaped than in the closely related genus Stapelia, and often striped vividly in contrasting colors or tones, some glossy, others matte and wrinkled depending on the species concerned. Frequently the flowers are colored a variation of red, yellow or brown. To pollinate, the flowers attract flies by emitting a scent similar to that of carrion. The genus is considered close to the genera Stapelia and Hoodia. Phylogenetic studies have shown the genus to be monophyletic, and most closely related to the genus Tavaresia, and to a widespread branch of stapeliads comprising the genera Orbea, Piaranthus and Stapelia.The name of the plant is in honor of Justus van Heurne (1587–1653?) a Dutch missionary, botanist, and doctor, who is reputed to have been the first European to document and collect South African Cape plants. His surname has variations (van Horne, Heurnius, van Heurnius), however it was misspelled by the plant collector.Various species of Huernia are considered famine food by the inhabitants of Konso special woreda in southern Ethiopia. The local inhabitants, who call the native species of this genus baqibaqa indiscriminately, eat it with prepared balls of sorghum (kurkufa); they note that baqibaqa tastes relatively good and has no unpleasant side-effects when boiled and consumed. As a result, local farmers encouraged it to grow on stone walls forming the terraces, where it does not compete with other crops.\\n\\nSpecies\\nThe follow species of Huernia are found in Africa (East Africa, South Africa and Ethiopia) and Arabia (Saudi Arabia, Yemen).\\nformerly includedmoved to Angolluma\\n\\nHuernia sprengeri now Angolluma sprengeri\\nPassage 2:\\nDictyosperma\\nDictyosperma is a monotypic genus of flowering plant in the palm family found in the Mascarene Islands in the Indian Ocean (Mauritius, Réunion and Rodrigues). The sole species, Dictyosperma album, is widely cultivated in the tropics but has been farmed to near extinction in its native habitat. It is commonly called princess palm or hurricane palm, the latter owing to its ability to withstand strong winds by easily shedding leaves. It is closely related to, and resembles, palms in the genus Archontophoenix. The genus is named from two Greek words meaning \"net\" and \"seed\" and the epithet is Latin for \"white\", the common color of the crownshaft at the top of the trunk.\\n\\nDescription\\nThe ringed trunks are solitary at 15 cm in diameter with a slight bulge at the base, occasionally reaching up to 12 m in height. The crownshaft is over a meter tall, swollen at the base, and covered in white wax— which has given the palm its epithet album— and small, matted brown hairs, producing a rounded leaf crown 4.5 m wide and 3 m tall. The 2.5 to 3 m leaves are borne on short 30 cm petioles; the arching leaflets are pointed at the apice, from 60 – 90 cm, dark green in color, and emerge from the rachis in a single plane.\\nOn flowering, they produce up to six inflorescences which ring the trunk below the crownshaft, branched to one order, with white to yellow flowers, which are male and female; both pistillate and staminate flowers have three sepals and three petals, the former being smaller than the latter. The ovoid fruit ripen to purple or black in color, containing one brown, ellipsoidal seed.\\nThree varieties are currently recognized:\\n\\nDictyosperma album var. album (Bory) Scheff. - Mauritius, Réunion\\nDictyosperma album var. aureum Balf.f. in J.G.Baker - Rodrigues Island\\nDictyosperma album var. conjugatum H.E.Moore & J.Guého - 2 remaining specimens on Île Ronde of Mauritius (Characterised by shorter trunk and white leaf-scar)\\n\\nDistribution and habitat\\nLiving in the coastal forests of the Mascarenes, they experience warm temperatures, high humidity and regular rainfall.\\n\\nAsterolecanium dictyospermae\\nAsterolecanium dictyospermae is a species of sap sucking scale insect found only on Île Ronde on the two remaining Dictyosperma album var. conjugatum specimens. It apparently evolved on Île Ronde and became restricted to feeding upon the island\\'s endemic variety, and due to interbreeding (between varieties) on Mauritius itself which jeopardized reproductive potential, the scale insect increased in population as a result of stress upon the host, which then threatens the existence of both host and scale insect.\\n```\\n\\nQuestion: Are both Dictyosperma, and Huernia described as a genus?\\n\\n[/INST]\\nAnswer:\\n',\n",
